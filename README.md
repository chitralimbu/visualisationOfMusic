# visualisationOfMusic
My final year disseration project.

The aim of this project was to create a software which reads a piece of music and creates a visualisation. 

It is created using a Python tool music21 (http://web.mit.edu/music21/) and creates the visualisation by 
reading the musical data from a MXL file (http://www.musicxml.com/music-in-musicxml/).

Various open-source MXL can be found in (https://musescore.com/sheetmusic).

The software reads all the musical information from the MXL file and determines various shapes, colours based
on the results of a survey I created.(https://github.com/dharanboi/survey).

Music21 is a fairly new concept, the documentation can be found (http://web.mit.edu/music21/), its a powerfool tool
which allows you to create and analyse every piece of detail found in the music sheet. 
My visualisation tool attempts to create visualisations using Music21 and MXL examples can be found in the JPEG files.
It's still buggy, a few of the MXL generated errors, however many did succeed. 

The methods to extract Musical information I needed to create the visualisation can be found in the Extracting_musical_information.py
file. and the visualisation is created in the visualisation.py file.
